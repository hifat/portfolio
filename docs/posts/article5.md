# Cheevamittr

I contributed as a Maintainer for the Cheevamittr project, which aims to provide equal access to quality end-of-life care. I implemented structured logging with Zap to improve issue tracking and timely debugging. Additionally, I refactored the PDF Service codebase to enhance readability and maintainability for future developers.
