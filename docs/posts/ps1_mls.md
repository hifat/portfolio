# Mallow Sale API

A lightweight and easy-to-use point-of-sale (POS) system built for daily operations at my family’s small restaurant. The system includes essential features to support sales operations, calculate ingredient costs, and suggest optimal selling prices. I also designed and deployed the infrastructure using modern DevOps tools including Jenkins for CI, ArgoCD for CD, SonarQube for code quality, and K8s for orchestration.
